<p>For a safe, smooth and happy return to classes we are bound to adhere to the conditions laid out by the Church Halls and Summerhall Venue in conjunction with The Royal Academy of Dance.</p>

<ul>
<li>Children over 5 are required to ware a mask (unless exempt) when entering or leaving the building. For Grade 3's and upwards, please make your own way into the building 5 minutes before class time.</li>

<li>Parents are asked to please not enter the church grounds or gardens when dropping off and collecting children.</li>

<li>There will be no changing facilities for the moment, so please could the girls arrive with ballet clothes underneath street clothes if they can.</li>

<li>No food is allowed although personal bottled water is fine.</li>

<li>If your child is unwell in any way, be it a small cough or sniffle, or a close contact (family/friend/class member) is quarantining, they must NOT attend class unless they have tested negative for covid.</li> 

<li>Please keep your mobile phones switched on in case we need to contact you if your child becomes unwell.</li>

<li>Please arrive in good time for classes</li>

<p>
A very warm welcome to the Grange School of Ballet website!
</p>

<p>
We are located in Marchmont and Newington areas of Edinburgh with classes taking place at St
Catherine’s Argyle and Mayfield Salisbury Churches as well as Summerhall Venue.
</p>
<p>
At Grange School of Ballet we specialise in ballet training offering younger children from the age of 3
years, exciting and fun classes with a gentle introduction to the first steps in ballet. For those who
wish to take exams we follow the Royal Academy of Dance curriculum and present pupils for exams
from Grade 1 to Grade 8 and vocational levels from Inter Foundation.</a>
</p>


<p>
Our classes are open to children of all levels with the primary aim of bringing the joy of dance to all.
</p>

<p>
We are dedicated to ensuring each and every one of our pupils has the best possible dance training,
whether they wish to take the path of exams or not. We aim to develop good and strong dance
technique as we progress through the grades alongside teaching and developing artistic expression
and musicality.
</p>


<p>
Whilst we are committed to helping and encouraging pupils to reach their full potential in
preparation for RAD exams (for those who wish to take this route), all pupils are also able to display
their progress made in class by performing in our school shows, which take the form of a full length
classical ballet. These performances take place at Churchill Theatre - always a great experience and
fun for the children and equally for family and friends in the audience!
</p>

<p>
Please do get in touch with us if your child would like to come along for a trial lesson to one of our
classes. All are warmly welcome!
</p>
